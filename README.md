## An example of TCP and UDP sockets
### When the client connects to the server, the server prints the IP address and port number of the client. 
1. The client accepts two integers x and y as  input from a user. 
1. The client sends x and y to the server.
1. The server prints an ID and the values x and y  it receives, and computes x + y
1. The server then sends the result back to the client.
1. Upon receiving the result, the client prints an ID, current date and time, and the result.
